This project contains more than 1,000 CSS3-based graphics code samples (think "swatches") with linear gradients, radial gradients, box-shadows, transforms, reflections, 2D/3D effects, and 2D/3D animation. Surprisingly, these code samples create visual effects that require only rudimentary features of CSS in conjunction with CSS3-specific features.

What you'll get: code samples for rendering various 2D shapes, including rectangles, circles, triangular shapes, ellipses, oval arcs, checkerboard patterns, and diagonal lines, combined with linear and radial gradients to create unusual visual effects (sort of like Matisse-meets-Warhol-meets-Jefferson-Airplane in the 21st century). The code samples attempt to explore the capabilities and limitations of CSS3, and I hope that the inclusion of a massive number of code samples will increase the likelihood that you'll find something that appeals to you.

The code samples were tested successfully in Chrome on Windows Vista and Chrome (version 17) on a Macbook; however, the code for browser-specific extensions for Mozilla, Opera, Firefox, and IE is not included. Interestingly, some code samples render differently (and better) on Chrome/Windows Vista and on Chrome/Linux than on Chrome/Macbook. In addition, some of the long-running code samples (four minutes for those that have 240 embedded in the filenames) are very CPU-intensive, so it's better to view them on a laptop instead of a tablet or a smart phone, lest you drain your battery.

Among the tablets tested thusfar, iOS devices are the best in terms of both performance and visual quality, based on a randomly selected set of code samples. Another interesting point: in some Canvas-based graphics samples, an iPod Touch outperforms the Nook Color in terms of rendering speed of the graphics.

A randomly selected set of CSS3 2D/3D samples that are part of HTML5 hybrid Android applications (as well as PhoneGap-based apps) render very nicely on both an Asus Prime 10" tablet with Android ICS and on an iPad3, as well as "pure" SVG code and CSS3/SVG combinations. The only SVG feature that does not work on Android ICS is SVG filters (perhaps Android 5 supports SVG filters, which AFAIK will soon be the same as CSS filters), which will also be tested on an iPad3.

As you'll soon see, there are many many similar samples that are often propagated across multiple download files, which might help you find the subset of code samples that are of interest to you. As you might also surmise, these code samples do not represent production-quality code, nor do they reflect any best practices, so code refactoring would be a good idea. Future code samples will probably contain examples of CSS3/SVG graphics.

The recommended order for viewing the code samples:
```
css3-samples.zip
css3-graphics-reflect.zip
css3-graphics-reflect-animation.zip
css3-graphics-animation2D.zip
css3-graphics-animation3DUpdated.zip
css3-graphics-ovals-animation3D.zip
css3-graphics-ovals-arcs-animation3D.zip
css3-graphics-ovals-arcs2-animation3D.zip
```
Note that the CSS3 code samples in css3-graphics-animation3D.zip have been superseded by the code samples contained in css3-graphics-animation3DUpdated.zip.

There are some cases where an HTML file does not specify the correct corresponding CSS stylesheet, and sometimes the HTML is not well-formed (propagated because of my haste as I wrote the code samples), but in each of those cases, you can easily make the necessary corrections.
